splice:

1) Create an array and use the splice method to remove elements from the middle of the array.

2) Create a function which takes an array, index, and number of elements, and uses splice to remove elements from the array.


reverse:

1) Create an array and use the reverse method to reverse the reordering of its elements.

2) Create a function which takes an array and uses reverse to reverse the order of elements.


concat:

1) Create two arrays and use the concat method to combine them into one array.

2) Create a function which takes two arrays and uses concat to combine them into a one array.


includes:

1) Create an array and use the includes method to check if the array contains an element.

2) Create a function which takes an array and an element and uses includes to check if element is in array.


filters:

1) Create an array of numbers and use the filter method to create a new array containing only odd numbers.

2) Create a function which takes an array and a callback function and uses a filter to create a new array containing the elements that satisfy the condition.


maps:

1) Create an array of numbers and use the map method to create a new array that contains the squares of each number.

2) Create a function that takes an array and a converter function and uses map to create a new array in which each element receives a string to value



Additional tasks:

1) Create a function that takes an array of numbers, filters out the even numbers, and then returns a new array in which each even  number is multiplied by 2.

2) Create a function that takes an array and two indices and returns a new array containing the elements between those indices in reverse order.

3) Create a function that takes an array of numbers, filters out more than 10, and returns a new array containing the first three 
    elements of the result.


Practices in using arrays methods and create functions.
No issue during the working on code.
